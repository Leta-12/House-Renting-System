Here is a customized README.md template for your House Renting System project, tailored for a GitHub repository:

House Renting System
Project Overview
The House Renting System is an application designed to facilitate the process of house renting. It enables house owners to list their properties and allows customers to search for houses, inquire about them, and rent them. Admins manage the properties and user roles within the system. The backend of the system is built using Java and connects to a MySQL database for persistent data storage.

Key Features
Admin Dashboard:

Manage properties and users.
Approve or reject house listings.
View customer inquiries and manage status.
Owner Dashboard:

Add, edit, and delete property listings.
View all inquiries made by customers.
Customer Dashboard:

Register and login to the system.
Search for properties based on location, price, and type.
Inquire about properties and rent them.
Property Inquiry Management:

Customers can inquire about properties.
Admin can accept or reject inquiries.
Track the status of inquiries.
Technologies Used
Java: Backend development, including the business logic and control flow.
MySQL: Database used to store information about properties, users, and inquiries.
JavaFX (optional): For the potential graphical user interface (GUI) implementation (if applicable).
Database Schema
Properties Table:

id INT: Unique property identifier (Primary Key).
name VARCHAR(255): Property name.
description TEXT: Detailed description of the property.
price DECIMAL(10,2): Rent price of the property.
Customers Table:

id INT: Unique customer identifier (Primary Key).
name VARCHAR(255): Customer name.
email VARCHAR(255): Customer email.
password VARCHAR(255): Customer password (stored securely).
role ENUM('customer', 'admin', 'owner'): User role (admin, customer, or owner).
Inquiries Table:

id INT: Unique inquiry identifier (Primary Key).
property_id INT: Foreign Key linked to the properties table.
customer_id INT: Foreign Key linked to the customers table.
inquiry_date TIMESTAMP: Date and time the inquiry was made.
status ENUM('Pending', 'Accepted', 'Rejected'): Inquiry status.
Installation Guide
Prerequisites
Java 8+: Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine.
MySQL: Set up a MySQL server instance for the backend database.
Steps to Set Up
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-renting-system.git
cd house-renting-system
Set up the MySQL Database:

Log into MySQL and create the renting_house database:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE DATABASE renting_house;
USE renting_house;
Create the Tables:

Run the following SQL queries to create the necessary tables for properties, customers, and inquiries:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE properties (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    password VARCHAR(255),
    role ENUM('customer', 'admin', 'owner')
);

CREATE TABLE inquiries (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    property_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    inquiry_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status ENUM('Pending', 'Accepted', 'Rejected') DEFAULT 'Pending',
    FOREIGN KEY (property_id) REFERENCES properties(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);
Configure Database Connection:

In the projectâ€™s source code, ensure the database connection settings (host, username, password) are correctly configured in the database connection class.
Run the Application:

After setting up the database, compile and run the Java application.
To compile and run the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
javac -d bin src/*.java
java -cp bin houserentinge.Houserentinge
How to Use

Future Improvements
User Authentication: Enhance user security with hashed passwords and email verification.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Add a user-friendly GUI using JavaFX.
Payment Integration: Implement payment gateways to process rental transactions.
